description: Margaret Mackenzie, a spinster in her thirties, receives a large inheritance
  upon her brother's death. But the money comes with unlooked-for responsibilities
  especially a rash of unwelcome suitors. Miss Mackenzie, whom Trollope described
  as a very unattractive old maid nevertheless has more to recommend her than her
  newfound wealth.
